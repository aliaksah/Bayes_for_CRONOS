# Follow example in Yao 2018, do a repeated regression for rural and urban
# schools to explore if the association between variables that reflect identification,
# integration, participation or motivation relate differs in the rural and urban context.
# First, a descriptive analysis will be carried out to determine whether different 
# patterns can be identified. Variables that affect the composition of the school (e. g.
# fraction of non-natives) will not be taken into account. This task refers only to the first step.

# Not exactly like Yao, but seven key predictors, each key predictor has
# a own model in the stack and contains the other predictors in the same form.
# Logistic regression is non-collapsible and therefore the combination matters for
# the power to predict certain regions of the outcome.

# Todo: decide if a certain predictor based on student or-school-level,
# use similar predictors and use one on each level, maybe also escs
# create data frame
